# TrivialUI #

### Overview ###

TrivialUI is a GUI library for Python, which aims to provide as simple and Python-native an interface as possible. As the name implies, the aim is for creation of a GUI to be as small an additional step as possible, so that even small ad hoc scripts can offer a useful UI.

This is currently highly experimental, and not likely to be usable for anything much.

The UI itself is provided by PyQt5, so this is a dependency.
