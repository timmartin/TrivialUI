TrivialUI documentation
=======================


TrivialUI is a Python library that aims to make it as easy as possible
to make your Python code into GUI Python code. It's not intended as a
full replacement for a GUI library like PySide; if you want full
control so you can make the greatest interface, then TrivialUI won't
give you what you want. But if you want a UI when you didn't even
think you had time to create one, then this might be your thing.

At least, that's the plan. Currently it's at a very early stage of
development.
